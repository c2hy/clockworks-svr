# Clockworks Server
Distributed Timer Service



# Software Architecture Description

This software consists of three main parts: Clockworks Server, SDK, and Regular Timing Libs. They rely on each other to provide a comprehensive time management and synchronization solution. The following is a detailed description of each part:



## 1. Clockworks Server

### Functional Description:

- Clockworks Server is the core part of the entire system, responsible for providing timer creation services in a distributed environment, mainly used in scenarios where high precision for timers is not required.
- Supports high concurrent access and distributed deployment to ensure system reliability and scalability.



### Key Components:

- **Timer Management Module**: Allows creation, deletion, and management of timers, supporting various timing tasks (e.g., one-time timers, periodic timers, etc.).
- **Time Synchronization Module**: Uses NTP or PTP protocols for time synchronization to ensure timer triggering consistency.
- **Time Management API**: Provides HTTP interfaces for SDK and other clients to access timer services.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Records system operation logs and provides monitoring interfaces for system health checks and performance tuning.



## 2. SDK

### Functional Description:

- The SDK (Software Development Kit) is the bridge connecting Clockworks Server and applications.
- Provides simple and easy-to-use interfaces to help developers integrate timer functions into their applications.
- Supports multiple programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, C++, etc.) to meet different development needs.



### Key Components:

- **API Encapsulation**: Encapsulates Clockworks Server's APIs, providing a unified interface for applications to call.
- **Timer Client**: Implements client-side timer logic, ensuring that applications can interact with the server to create and manage timers.
- **Error Handling and Retry Mechanism**: Ensures that the SDK can handle errors and perform retries in case of network failures or server unavailability.



## 3. Regular Timing Libs Mock Implementation

### Functional Description:

- Retains the original API of commonly used timer libraries, while the underlying implementation calls Clockworks Server through the SDK to achieve timing functions.
- In this way, users can continue to use familiar timer APIs without needing to understand the underlying timer service implementation.



### Key Components:

- **API Compatibility Layer**: Retains the original API of timer libraries without changing the user's usage method.
- **Underlying Switching Module**: Switches the underlying implementation of timers to call Clockworks Server through the SDK, ensuring timer services in a distributed environment.
